      <h1 class="stepTitle"><u>How to Improve</u></h1>
      <p>We understand that getting better at this game can be really really hard, but <br>
      dont let that discourage you from trying! To help in your journey we've assembled some <br>
      links that we think will really speed up your improvement.</p>

      <h1 class="stepTitle"><u>Beginner:</u></h1>
      <p>We classify a beginner as someone who has never really gotten involved with the <br>
      competitive scene. Someone who doesn't know what "wavedashing" or "L-canceling" are, or <br>
      has heard of them but is not sure how to perform them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Picking your character</li>
        <li>Wavedashing</li>
        <li>L-canceling</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="stepTitle"><u>Intermediate:</u></h1>
      <p>An intermediate is someone who has learned the above, and is able to perform them with <br>
      relative consitency. Ontop of this, they feel comfortable moving with their character <br>
      and are beginning to think about advanced techniques they can perform.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Idk just put some advanced stuff in here</li>
        <li>Something about edge guarding maybe?</li>
        <li>Stuff along the lines of ledge dashing</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="stepTitle"><u>Advanced:</u></h1>
      <p>An advanced player is someone who is able to perform all the advanced techniques <br>
      of their character with relative ease and is now looking at the game in a more strategic <br>
      sense, thinking of things such as specific matchup knowledge and how they control the stage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Link to some smashboard threads on matchup knowledge i guess?</li>
        <li>try to find a link to someone talking about the game like chess</li>
        <li>link to some youtube channels of analysis (druggedfox, ginger, mango, armada, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
